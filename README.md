I do not own any of this code, the fixes will be minimal in nature.

This repository is not meant to redistribute the sources of the mods it pertains to; it is intended to distribute the fixes for a specific version to these mods.

# Fixes



# BiggerThreats:
  A change, likely in Avorion's vanilla scripts makes the version incompatible. the following commit should resolve this:
  https://github.com/Joeppie/AvorionModFixes/commit/4feb7b016967fd4e16c88252412fce6f6615faff
  
  A second commit: 
  https://github.com/Joeppie/AvorionModFixes/commit/66f07d2a32f9bcf8d9a95992a9c529225c61f4e8
  
  Should resolve another problem, of unknown cause.
  


~~# OOSProduction:
A problem exists where a file or function cannot be found; I am not sure where this problem stems from, it might be a compatibility problem between two mods.~~ Accounted for. (this is due to Avorion's default behaviour of attempting to make clients run the same script as the server does; this leads to errors when that script is not present on the client and can usually be safely ignored.)
